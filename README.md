Hello!

If you are reading this, then you must be a top notch stalker, or in a less likely scenario i have become a famous individual in the future and people is researching into the beginning of my coding career.

So

this is just a training session in odin regarding some basic html stuff that i already know, but i'm doing anyways because it encourages you to use git, which i think is useful to understand and manage for my future career.
